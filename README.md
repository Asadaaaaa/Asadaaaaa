<p align="center">I'm a highly self motivated Back-End Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience in NodeJS, ExpressJS, and relational databases. Skilled in software development strategies, CI/CD, server management, and DevOps, I excel at building scalable and efficient systems. With 3 years of professional experience, I'm also pursuing a Software Engineering degree at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. I embrace leadership, adaptability, and teamwork. Goal-oriented, self-motivated, and open-minded, I quickly learn new technologies and simplify complex problems into fast, effective solutions. Most of the programming knowledge I got is self-taught, I learn by reading documentation and from videos.</p>
